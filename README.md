# 🛡️ SecureVault

A secure, simple, and reliable desktop application for managing your sensitive information, built with C#.

---

## 📖 About The Project

SecureVault is a C# desktop application designed to provide a safe and encrypted local storage for your most sensitive data, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or secure notes. In an age of constant data breaches, managing critical information locally with strong encryption offers a robust layer of security and peace of mind.

This project was built as a clean, lightweight, and easy-to-use alternative to cloud-based managers, ensuring that you—and only you—have access to your data.
